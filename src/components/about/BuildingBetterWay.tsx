            Probit was established with a clear conviction: that infrastructure investment decisions could, and should, be made with more clarity, rigour and confidence.
            <br />
            <br />
            When we started out on the AIM journey, many organisations were still relying on spreadsheets, static reports, or portfolio-level models to decide how billions in capital would be spent. The process was slow, opaque, and often shaped more by assumptions than by evidence.
            <br />
            <br />
            We believed there was a better way. So we set out to build a platform that could bring together risk, performance, cost and regulatory alignment, and optimise those decisions at the level of individual assets.
            <br />
            <br />
            That platform is AIM. It was designed from the ground up to meet the specific challenges of capital-intensive infrastructure sectors, and has been refined and expanded ever since in collaboration with our clients, partners and regulators.
            <br />
            <br />
            Today, AIM is used across the UK and internationally by organisations responsible for managing water, gas, roads and other critical assets. And weâ€™re still driven by the same principle that started it: better data, better models, better decisions.
