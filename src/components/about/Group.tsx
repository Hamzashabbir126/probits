            Probit are infrastructure planning software specialists, helping organisations make smarter, more transparent decisions about their long-term investments.
            <br />
            <br />
            Founded in 2010 and based in Wales, UK, we've built our business around a single platform, AIM, initially branded as Asset Investment Manager.
            <br />
            <br />
            AIM is used by utilities, energy networks, transport agencies and local authorities to plan billions of dollars in investment, balancing performance, cost, risk and sustainability at the level of individual assets.
            <br />
            <br />
            We're a product-first company, rather than a consultancy. Our focus is on building adaptable, powerful software that supports our users, partners and regulators in making better decisions under real-world constraints.
